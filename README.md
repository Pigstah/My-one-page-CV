# My-one-page-CV

This a project I've been working on for a little while now. 

I wanted to create a simple website from scratch to understand the process and to help when applying for jobs in the future.

This was created using flask as a web app, basic html and my pure CSS (a little java but nothing major).

The main aim for this project was to get my hands dirty with some development and the learn a lot more about DevOps.

I'm planning to use Docker, Ansible and Github actions to allow me to automate the deployment and updates!
